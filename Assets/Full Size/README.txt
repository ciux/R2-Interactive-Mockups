"assets/full size"

These files are the full-size Balsamiq assets, ready to use in Catalyst except for their size - they're a little too big and need to be reduced to 83% of original size.  The reduced-size assets are saved to the parent folder "assets", to be used in Catalyst.

The original unmodified Balsamiq assets as sent from Carolanne Fisher are in "assets/originals".  See the README file there.
