"assets/originals"

These files are original unmodified Balsamiq assets as sent from Carolanne Fisher.  If she sent more than one version of the same asset, the filenames are prepended with the date they were recieved.

Some files contain a single asset (e.g. "App Window Basic.png"). They're just copied to folder "assets/full size".


Some contain several assets (e.g. "Jan 26 IS Edit Panel.png") and I use Gimp to separate them into their own files, which are saved to "assets/full size".


Some of the assets in "assets/full size" then require slight modification (again using Gimp).  These are modified in-place.


The assets in "assets/full size" are called full size because they're a little too big to be used directly in Catalyst, and need to be reduced to 83% of original size.  The reduced-size assets are saved to the parent folder "assets", to be used in Catalyst.
