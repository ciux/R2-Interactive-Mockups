"Platform Status Detail Views" is a wrapper for "panel animation".

Logically they should be copied to the same folder, BUT! due to the way Flash sources in swf files, for the demo to work on the website THEY MUST GO IN DIFFERENT FOLDERS:

o) the wrapper "Platform Status Detail Views.swf" goes in the "Panel Interaction Demos" folder
o) the "panel animation.swf" goes in the website root folder (the same folder as the web page file "r2.html")
