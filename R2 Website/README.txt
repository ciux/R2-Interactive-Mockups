The file "panel animation" is used by the Platform Status Detail Views demo in the Panel Interaction Demos folder.

It should logically be in that same folder, BUT! due to the way Flash sources in swf files, it MUST remain HERE, in the same folder as the web page "r2.html".  If you move it out of this folder, the Platform Status Detail Views demo will not work.
