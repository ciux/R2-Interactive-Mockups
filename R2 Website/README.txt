The files "panel animation.swf" and "panel editing animations.swf" are used by the wrapper flash files in the Panel Interaction Demos folder.

They should logically be in the same folder as the wrappers, BUT! due to the way Flash sources in swf files, they MUST remain HERE, in the same folder as the web page "r2.html".  If you move them out of this folder, those demos will NOT work.
